<p>Everyone talks about the bright lights of cities, but what about when all those neon signs, street lights and strobe lights blur into one and obscure your view of the perfect night? It is often easy to lost in the whirlwind of promoter promises and the lure of amazing-sounding DJ sets and drinks deals.</p>

<p>That is where Citydrip comes in. Inspired by student life and our understanding of getting used to a new city, we use real-life experiences to curate the best nights that there are, whether you are looking to splash out or are a student on a budget.</p>

<p>We are mostly based in Manchester, but often review nights in London and other cities as well.</p>
